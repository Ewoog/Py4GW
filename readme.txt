## 📖 Key Features and Documentation

### Manual Hero Skill Casting

Py4GW supports manual control of hero skills, allowing you to override hero AI and cast skills at precise moments. This is useful for combos, interrupts, and strategic gameplay.

**Quick Example:**
```python
import PySkillbar

skillbar = PySkillbar.Skillbar()
skillbar.GetContext()

# Make hero 1 use skill slot 1 on current target
result = skillbar.HeroUseSkill(0, 1, 1)
```

- [DEMO_HeroSkillCasting.py](DEMO/DEMO_HeroSkillCasting.py) - Interactive demo
